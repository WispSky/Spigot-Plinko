# Plinko-Spigot
 Simple Spigot plugin for Minecraft Plinko
 
### How To Use
Pretty simple! You can create a plinko board of any size and orientation desired. Any blocks can be used. When you want to drop a plinko block, simply type /plinko. You will be notified in the chat that plinko mode is active. Placing a block while in plinko mode will make it drop through the board.<br>
Be careful! In its current state, blocks will continue falling if they don't fall into a pocket of blocks like in the preview.

### Future Ideas
This plugin could be further developed to make a sort of loot-box system where the item is chosen depending on where the plinko block lands.<br>
It could also be turned into a minigame, or at least part of one. I had a little idea about picking a random item using plinko, and the player must then attempt to find their item within X minutes, and then move to the next item. Any player that doesn't acquire their item in time would be eliminated.<br>
In any sense, the plinko is more of visual than anything when it comes to these ideas, but the randomness of where it will land is very satisfying to watch. It can, of course, be sped up easily just by changing the delay between steps in the PlinkoBlock class.
